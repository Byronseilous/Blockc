# Blockchain Challenge

## Description

The Blockchain Challenge project comprises five small tasks aimed at providing hands-on experience in blockchain development and decentralized application (DApp) creation. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of blockchain technology, enabling you to gain practical knowledge and skills in this exciting field.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Wallet Connection

**Description**: Implement wallet connection to interact with blockchain networks securely.

**Requirements**:
- Choose a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).
- Integrate a wallet connection library (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).
- Allow users to connect and disconnect their wallets.
- Display wallet balances and addresses.

### Task 2: Uploading JPEG File and Minting it as NFT

**Description**: Enable users to upload JPEG files and mint them as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the chosen blockchain.

**Requirements**:
- Implement a file upload feature for JPEG images.
- Create a smart contract (e.g., ERC-721) to represent NFTs.
- Mint NFTs with unique properties from the uploaded images.
- Store NFT metadata (e.g., image URL, title, description) on the blockchain.

### Task 3: List the Minted NFT in OpenSea Marketplace

**Description**: Integrate with a blockchain marketplace like OpenSea to list and display the minted NFTs.

**Requirements**:
- Connect your application to the OpenSea marketplace API.
- List the minted NFTs for sale on OpenSea.
- Enable users to view detailed information about each NFT.
- Implement basic trading features such as buying and selling NFTs.

### Task 4: Create a Token Gated Access

**Description**: Implement token-based access control to restrict certain features or content to users who hold specific tokens or NFTs.

**Requirements**:
- Define a set of features or content that require token-based access.
- Create a smart contract to manage access tokens.
- Implement access control logic to grant or deny access based on token ownership.

### Task 5: Build a Simple DEX (Decentralized Exchange)

**Description**: Develop a simple decentralized exchange (DEX) for peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading.

**Requirements**:
- Implement order book functionality for limit and market orders.
- Enable users to create and fill orders.
- Support common trading pairs (e.g., ETH/DAI).
- Integrate a decentralized blockchain network for trade settlement.
